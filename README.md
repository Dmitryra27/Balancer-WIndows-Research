# Balancer-WIndows-Research
In this repository, the mathematics of the Balancer exchange is used and a study of the idea of reducing non-permanent losses with limited trading time is presented. 

Three trading strategies were considered to change the composition of the pool. 
Strategy 1 is a sharp change in the composition of the pool. 
Strategy 2 is a gradual uniform change in the composition of the pool over a certain time interval. 
Strategy 3 is a gradual change in the composition of the pool depending on external prices. 
The conclusion that can be drawn from the last chart, the loss mainly depends on the price situation in the market.
